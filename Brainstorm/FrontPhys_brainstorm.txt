Background (approx. 100-150 words):
Quasi-normal modes, namely the complex frequencies encoding the linear response of resonators under tiny perturbations, have acquired major importance in recent years in different settings of physics, ranging from astrophysical and theoretical problems in gravitational physics to the study of scattering properties of optical nanoresonators. Beyond physics, the subject makes direct contact with the study of the spectral and dynamical properties of non-selfadjoint operators, a very active area of current research in applied and fundamental mathematics with direct applications in physics, from hydrodynamics and turbulence to non-Hermitian quantum mechanics. In spite of these converging and complementary interests and working knowledge, research interchanges among the involved subcommunities seem quite scarce. In this setting, the central notion of Pseudospectrum provides a systematic framework furnishing a common arena to this interdisciplinary field of research, namely a crossroad in the physics and mathematics of open non-conservative systems.

Asymptotic symmetries?



To discuss 13/01/2022:

- Matthew Colbrook
- Rim Al Majdalany
- Harvard CMSA GR Seminar Invitation: March 
- Bradley Cownden
- QSimFP Seminar 2023: 20 March
- Retard start "Frontiers in Physics" to wait London and Harvard.



Issues:

- Fees: most agreements with first-world countries... (case of Spain
is... curious).
- Aggresitivity and timescales.
- All articles types in:
https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physics/for-authors/article-types
are allowed?

Rodrigo's concerns:
(i) pressure to finish it.
(ii) the money for the publications. 
I’d say it is important that everyone we contact are straightway aware of these constraints. 

Also, when agreeing to move forward:
do you have to sign anything? What are the consequences for not delivering, or delivering partially, or delaying the whole thing, or even giving up on the way… Is there any sort of breaking clause fee?
