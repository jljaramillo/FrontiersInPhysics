Issues:

- Fees: most agreements with first-world countries... (case of Spain
is... curious).
- Aggresitivity and timescales.
- All articles types in:
https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physics/for-authors/article-types
are allowed?

Rodrigo's concerns:
(i) pressure to finish it.
(ii) the money for the publications. 
I’d say it is important that everyone we contact are straightway aware of these constraints. 

Also, when agreeing to move forward:
do you have to sign anything? What are the consequences for not delivering, or delivering partially, or delaying the whole thing, or even giving up on the way… Is there any sort of breaking clause fee?
